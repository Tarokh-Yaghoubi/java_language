// This program begins with a call to main.

// In Java, a source file is officially called a "Compilation Unit".
// It is a text file that contains (among other things), one or more class definitions.

// NOTE: In Java all code must reside inside a class.
// By Convention, The name of the main class of the program, should match with the name of the file that holds the program.

// You should also pay attention that the capitalization of the filename should match the class name, this is because Java is case-sensitive.

// This convention may look arbitrary, but sometimes it is required, and also makes your program to be better organized.

// "Example" is an identifier that is the name of the class. The entire class definition, including all of its members, will be between (curly braces), {}
